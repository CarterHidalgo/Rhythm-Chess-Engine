Thingz to conisder

1. King safety
Even through blocking pieces (having pawns in 6 squares in the corner) 
Oponent pieces inline to next to the king

2. Controling important squares

3. Number of pieces (duh) 


Dynamic vs Static
Dynamic: 
Static: Pawns protecting each other or being protected (not about to fall apart) 
Active piece: a piece that is controling more squares and is well positioned 

How many pieces are protecting each other (and protecting and attacking bitboards to see if there are any pieces that are hanging)
Protect or move - increase depth to make sure no negative countermoves


Knights on the rim are dim
Pawn pushing too far (controlled squares!) 
Controlling squares in the center or more advanced (per side) unless
the king is nearby 

Controling a square:
1. Having a pawn protecting the square (opponent pawn pushed too far) 
2. A square is controlled until it isn't (supported pawns/pieces) 

Relative piece value is dependent on number of controled squares and
what is on. Move *bishops* to places that control more squares and are importantly
not blocked by their own pawns 
Bishops should not stare at their own pawns or knights within 3 spaces or protected 
enemy pawns - dependent on the bishop not the pawns 

Rooks like open files and to be connected (middle game) not blocked by their own pawns 
10 or fewer non-pawn/king pieces means an endgame just for the other side 
Active king in an endgame 
8 moves is the end of the opening and the beginning of the mid-game
