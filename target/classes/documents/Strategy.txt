>> ChessBot Strategy Checklist <<

King safety
    A king that is being attacked or is in an attack neighborhood 
    even through blocking pieces is less safe than
    one which is not. A king that is behind its own pieces (has protection in the
    squares in front of it in the corner) is more safe. 

Controling important squares
    Controling a square:
    Having a pawn protecting the square (opponent pawn pushed too far) 
    A square is controlled until it isn't (supported pawns/pieces) 
    A square is more tightly controlled if the opponent pawns which would have protected it have been pushed 
    Controlling squares in the center or squares which are more advanced unless the king is nearby
    Control squares that are near the king (lowers opponent king safety) 

Number of pieces
    Pawn: 1
    Knight: 3
    Bishop: 3/3.5
    Rook: 5
    Queen: 9
    King: 0 or infinite

Dynamic vs Static and Active Pieces
    Dynamic: More active pieces than non active pieces
    Static: Pawns protecting each other or being protected (strong pawn structure that is not about to fall apart) 
    Active piece: a piece that is controling more squares and is well positioned 

Piece Protection
    How many pieces are protecting each other (make sure there are no hanging pieces)
    Better to have strong interconnected pieces re-enforcing each other than not
    Protect or move unprotected piece - increase depth to make sure no negative countermoves (protecting
    one minor piece leads to a dead lost position)


Relative Piece Value
    "Knights on the rim are dim"
    
    Relative piece value is dependent on the number of squares that piece controls and what 
    square that piece is on. 

    Bishops: Move bishops to places that control more squares and are importantly
    not blocked by their own pawns 
    Bishops should not stare at their own pawns or knights within 3 spaces or protected 
    enemy pawns - this is dependent on the bishop not the pawns 
    
    Rooks like open files and to be connected (in the middle game or later) and should not blocked by their own pawns 

Opening/Midgame/Endgame
    If the opponent has 10 or fewer non-pawn/king pieces this means you are in an endgame 
    You want to have an active king in an endgame (see prior definition of active) 
    ~8 moves is the end of the opening and the beginning of the mid-game 

Move
    A move is defined as 1 move for white and 1 move for black
